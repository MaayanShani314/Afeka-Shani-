        Golden Pavilion (Kinkaku-ji), Kyoto, Japan
        Kinkaku-ji, also known as the Golden Pavilion, is a stunning Zen Buddhist<br/>
        temple covered in gold leaf, set beside a serene reflective pond.<br/>
        Surrounded by meticulously designed Japanese gardens, it creates a breathtaking scene in every season - especially during<br/>
        autumn with vibrant foliage or winter with snow. It is one of Kyoto’s most iconic and photogenic landmarks.<br/>
